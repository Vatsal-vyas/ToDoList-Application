# ToDoList-Application
A simple and modern ToDo List web app built using Spring Boot for the backend and vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Users can add, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks. Data is persisted using H2 Database. The project demonstrates RESTful API integration, frontend-backend interaction, and basic CRUD functionality.
